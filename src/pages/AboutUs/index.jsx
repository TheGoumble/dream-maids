          <h2>How we got started</h2>
          <p className="text">
            Working over 10 years in the business of home care and cleaning
            service, our founder and proud mother of 3, Maria Garzon wanted to
            expand both her knowledge of the industry onto others just like her
            as well as bring her years of expertise in the form of peace and joy
            into the homes of many she could not reach before as a freelance
            housecleaner. Beginning as a solo business as a way to support her
            children she now embraces her first years of experience and uses
            these lessons to teach and train her extraordinary staff. Utilizing
            the support of her staff and children she attempts to satisfy every
            client that comes to her in need and hopes for you to be the next
            approaching client.
